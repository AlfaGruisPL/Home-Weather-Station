# Home Weather Station Website

This website project was created for a home weather station. The website aims to present various parameters related to weather conditions and electricity production at home, based on two separate sets of photovoltaic panels. Additionally, it utilizes sensors to measure the electricity consumption at home and monitors the temperature of the central heating furnace using a handmade device based on the Arduino platform. Information about weather conditions outside the home, air pollution, sunlight, humidity, and pressure is also provided, thanks to a homemade weather station based on the ESP8266.

* Electricity Production: The website displays current electricity production from two sets of photovoltaic panels and the electricity consumption by the home. It calculates sum, difference, and other parameters related to electricity production and consumption.
* Furnace Temperature Monitoring: It monitors the temperature of the central heating furnace using temperature sensors connected to a device based on the Arduino platform.
* Weather Conditions: It presents information about the temperature outside the home, air pollution, sunlight, and humidity through a weather station based on the ESP8266.
* Interactive Interface: It provides an intuitive user interface for easy browsing of presented data.

Technologies Used

* Backend: MySQL, PHP, Python ,NestJS
* Database: MySQL
* Hardware Integration: Arduino, ESP8266
